**Exploratory Data Analysis**
--
This is a collection of my work from Coursera's [Exploratory Data Analysis course](https://class.coursera.org/exdata-008) by Roger Peng.

Since this course primarily focuses on R, my goal is to gain familiarity with R under the data munging context.  However, with the advent of Pandas popularity and its advantage with data wrangling, I will also mirror the lessons and projects of this course by using Python's Pandas.  This effort will be loosely based on the approach taken by [herrfz](https://github.com/herrfz/dataanalysis).

**Results and approach to course's projects**

Project 1 - Loading Data, Analyzing Data (dplyr), Making Plots (base plot)

 - [Code](https://github.com/rtheman/EDA/tree/master/Project01/Code)
 - [Output](https://github.com/rtheman/EDA/tree/master/Project01/Output) (plots)

Project 2 - Loading and Analyzing more data (dplyr; Joins are interesting w/ dplyr), Making more plots (ggplot)

 - [Code](https://github.com/rtheman/EDA/tree/master/Project02/Code)
 - [Output](https://github.com/rtheman/EDA/tree/master/Project02/Output)
